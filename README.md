# Web clicking game

This is my first atempt at learning typescript because it seems much more user friendly then java script

## Browsing the code

First install the typescript compiler via npm

```bash
npm install --global typescript
```

if you ever want to edit the typescript make sure to always compile it to JS after saving
```bash
tsc index.ts
```
